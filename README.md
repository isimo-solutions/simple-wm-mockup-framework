# simple-wm-mockup-framework

This framework enables simple mocking of webMethods services by replacing them with other implementations using naming conventions dependent on the list of profiles. This is a very simple and powerful tool allowing one to provide mockups for external systems and to test webMethods solutions in separation.

This simple webMethods Mockup framework can be installed as invoke manager entry inside of the invokemanager.cnf config file.
